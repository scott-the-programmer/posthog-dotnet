# PostHog

## 2.13.3

### Patch Changes

- 14ea26f: Support fractional rollout percentages (for example `0.1`) when deserializing local evaluation payloads.

## 2.13.2

### Patch Changes

- a5c6a22: Normalize captured event timestamps to the equivalent UTC instant.

## 2.13.1

### Patch Changes

- 0c0fea0: Use the invariant culture when stringifying property values for feature flag local evaluation. Numeric property values such as `3.14` now stringify as `"3.14"` regardless of the host locale, so `exact`, `icontains`, `starts_with`, `ends_with`, and regex matching behave the same way the PostHog flags service does on machines using comma-decimal cultures.

## 2.13.0

### Minor Changes

- 61b26a3: Support the `starts_with`, `not_starts_with`, `ends_with`, and `not_ends_with` property filter operators in feature flag local evaluation. Matching is case-insensitive and mirrors `icontains`, so flags using these operators no longer fail local evaluation.

  Property filter operators this SDK version doesn't recognize now deserialize as `ComparisonOperator.Unknown` instead of failing the entire local evaluation response, so only the affected flag falls back to remote evaluation.

## 2.12.2

### Patch Changes

- 26057b5: Keep local feature flag evaluation available when `is_set` or `is_not_set` filters omit `value`, and support numeric values in filter arrays.

## 2.12.1

### Patch Changes

- 2c2d89f: Prevent `ProjectToken`-only configuration from logging the deprecated `ProjectApiKey` warning.
- dd2b355: Avoid mutating caller-provided property dictionaries when capturing events, capturing exceptions, and using identify, group identify, page view, screen view, or survey capture helpers.

## 2.12.0

### Minor Changes

- dd92ea1: Send minimal `$feature_flag_called` events when the server enables it (`minimalFlagCalledEvents` in the `/flags` v2 response or `minimal_flag_called_events` in the local evaluation payload) and the evaluated flag is not linked to an experiment. Minimal events keep a strict allowlist of flag evaluation properties and strip everything else, including the `$feature/<key>` enumeration and super properties. Experiment-linked flags and responses that do not carry the field continue to send the full event.

## 2.11.1

### Patch Changes

- 90e0c94: Standardize event buffering defaults at a 10,000-event queue, 100-event flush threshold, 100-event maximum batch size, and 5-second flush interval.

## 2.11.0

### Minor Changes

- a329a13: Add a `$feature_flag_has_experiment` boolean property to `$feature_flag_called` events when the server reports whether the flag is linked to an experiment. The property is omitted when the server does not report it (older deployments and legacy response formats).

## 2.10.0

### Minor Changes

- d9d59a5: Add `PostHogOptions.SecretKey` for local feature flag evaluation and remote config. It accepts either a Personal API Key (`phx_...`) or a Project Secret API Key (`phs_...`). The existing `PersonalApiKey` option is now a deprecated alias; when both are set, `SecretKey` takes precedence.

## 2.9.0

### Minor Changes

- d543f28: Add a before send callback for modifying or dropping fully enriched events.

## 2.8.7

### Patch Changes

- 048601e: Stop duplicating `distinct_id` inside `/flags` person properties.

## 2.8.6

### Patch Changes

- c631799: Retry remote feature flag requests after transient 502 and 504 responses.

## 2.8.5

### Patch Changes

- 256d2df: Add a per-client circuit breaker for feature flag requests after consecutive transient network failures, temporarily failing fast before probing for recovery.

## 2.8.4

### Patch Changes

- 211aa24: Add a feature flag request option for disabling GeoIP enrichment.

## 2.8.3

### Patch Changes

- 7bab8dc: Fall back to uncompressed batch uploads when local gzip compression fails.

## 2.8.2

### Patch Changes

- 0da29c6: Retry feature flag requests after transient network errors only. The feature flag request retry count defaults to 1 and can be set to 0 to disable retries.

## 2.8.1

### Patch Changes

- 60a2194: Preserve per-capture GeoIP override properties when super properties are configured.

## 2.8.0

### Minor Changes

- 788d9e0: Support the `early_exit` filter option in local feature flag evaluation, mirroring the server-side evaluation engine. When a flag's `filters.early_exit` is `true` and a condition group's property filters match (or the group has none) but the rollout percentage excludes the user, evaluation stops and the flag returns a definitive disabled result instead of falling through to later condition groups. A pure property-filter mismatch always falls through, even when `early_exit` is enabled. When the field is absent or `false`, existing behavior is preserved.
- 788d9e0: Add feature flag evaluation contexts via `PostHogOptions.EvaluationContexts`. `/flags` requests now send `evaluation_contexts` when configured.
- 788d9e0: Add a configurable `$is_server` event property (default `true`) so PostHog can identify server-side events. Set `PostHogOptions.IsServer` to `false` when using the SDK as a client/CLI so the device OS is attributed normally.
- 788d9e0: Add request-scoped server request context support for tracing headers and ASP.NET Core metadata.

### Patch Changes

- 788d9e0: Refactor duplicate internal SDK code paths without changing public API behavior.
- 788d9e0: Document public APIs and make `GroupCollection.TryAdd(Group)` store entries by group type instead of group key, matching the collection's one-group-per-type behavior.
- 788d9e0: Include group context in the `$feature_flag_called` dedupe cache key so group-scoped flags fire a separate event for each group a user is evaluated under, instead of being dedup-ed against the first group context the same `(distinctId, featureKey, response)` was seen under. The groups are canonicalized order-independently (`OrderBy(GroupType, StringComparer.Ordinal)`) so two equal collections built in different insertion orders still dedupe.
- 788d9e0: Return no-op results instead of throwing from public APIs when PostHog API calls fail.
- 788d9e0: Reject semver values with leading zeros in local flag evaluation. Per semver 2.0.0 §2, numeric identifiers must not include leading zeros — values like `1.07.3` are not valid semver and should not match targeting conditions. Both override values and flag values are now validated; invalid inputs cause `SemanticVersion.TryParse` to return false so the condition does not match.
- 788d9e0: Use the correct historical_migration wire field for batch capture payloads.

## 2.7.1

### Patch Changes

- 16583c8: Fix `AsyncBatchHandler` background flushing so transient batch send failures no longer permanently stop future flushes. `FlushAsync()` now also waits for an in-progress flush instead of returning early without doing work.

## 2.7.0

### Minor Changes

- db7fe08: Add the static `PostHogSdk` facade in the `PostHog.Sdk` namespace.

## 2.6.2

### Patch Changes

- 293539c: Disable the client without logging a project token error when the SDK is explicitly disabled or the project token is missing.

## 2.6.1

### Patch Changes

- 188e99a: test: release process
